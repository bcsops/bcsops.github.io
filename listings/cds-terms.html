        <h2>Definitions:</h2>
        <p><strong>Credit Default Swap (CDS):</strong> A financial contract where the Buyer of the CDS makes periodic payments to the Seller in exchange for protection against the default of a specified <strong>Reference Entity</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Reference Entity:</strong> The company, sovereign, or other entity whose credit risk is being transferred under this agreement. It is the entity whose default or other credit events trigger a payout under the CDS.</p>
        <p><strong>Credit Event:</strong> A predefined event that affects the creditworthiness of the Reference Entity, including but not limited to:
            <ul>
                <li>Bankruptcy</li>

        </p>
        <p><strong>Notional Amount:</strong> The face value or principal amount upon which the CDS contract is based. This is the amount the Seller will compensate the Buyer in the event of a Credit Event.</p>
        <p><strong>Premium/Spread:</strong> The regular payment made by the Buyer to the Seller over the life of the CDS contract. It is often expressed as an annualized percentage of the Notional Amount.</p>
        <p><strong>Settlement:</strong> The process following a Credit Event, where the Seller compensates the Buyer. There are two types of settlements:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Settlement:</strong> The Buyer delivers the Reference Entity's defaulted debt obligations to the Seller in exchange for the Notional Amount.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Settlement:</strong> The Seller pays the Buyer an agreed amount based on the market value of the Reference Entity's defaulted debt obligations.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> The date on which the CDS contract becomes active and the Buyer’s protection begins.</p>
        <p><strong>Termination Date:</strong> The date on which the CDS contract expires or ends unless a Credit Event has occurred earlier.</p>
        <p><strong>Accrued Premium:</strong> The portion of the Premium that has accumulated from the last payment date until the occurrence of a Credit Event or until contract termination.</p>
        <p><strong>Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (CDDC):</strong> An industry body that makes binding determinations regarding Credit Events, the Reference Entity, and settlement terms in the case of disputes.</p>
